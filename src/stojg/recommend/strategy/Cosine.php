 * Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors of an inner product space that measures the 
 * cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of 0° is 1, and it is less than 1 for any other angle. It is thus a 
 * judgement of orientation and not magnitude: two vectors with the same orientation have a Cosine similarity of 1, 
 * two vectors at 90° have a  similarity of 0, and two vectors diametrically opposed have a similarity of -1, 
 * independent of their magnitude
