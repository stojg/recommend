Quantum mechanics (QM – also known as quantum physics, or quantum theory) is a branch of physics which deals with 
physical phenomena at microscopic scales, where the action is on the order of the Planck constant. It departs from 
classical mechanics primarily at the quantum realm of atomic and subatomic length scales. Quantum mechanics provides a 
mathematical description of much of the dual particle-like and wave-like behavior and interactions of energy and matter.
It is the non-relativistic limit of quantum field theory (QFT), a theory that was developed later that combined quantum 
mechanics with relativity.

In advanced topics of quantum mechanics, some of these behaviors are macroscopic (see macroscopic quantum phenomena) and
emerge at only extreme (i.e., very low or very high) energies or temperatures (such as in the use of superconducting 
magnets). The name quantum mechanics derives from the observation that some physical quantities can change only in 
discrete amounts (Latin quanta), and not in a continuous (cf. analog) way. For example, the angular momentum of an 
electron bound to an atom or molecule is quantized. In the context of quantum mechanics, the wave–particle duality of
energy and matter and the uncertainty principle provide a unified view of the behavior of photons, electrons, and other
atomic-scale objects.

The mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are abstract. A mathematical function known as the wavefunction 
provides information about the probability amplitude of position, momentum, and other physical properties of a particle.
