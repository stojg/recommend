Eagle is a common name for some members of the bird family Accipitridae; it belongs to several genera that are not 
necessarily closely related to each other. Most of the more than sixty species of eagles are from Eurasia and Africa.
Outside this area, just eleven species can be found – two species (the Bald Eagle and Golden Eagle) in the United States
and Canada, nine species in Central America and South America, and three species in Australia.

Eagles are large, powerfully built birds of prey, with a heavy head and beak. Even the smallest eagles, like the Booted 
Eagle (Aquila pennata) (which is comparable in size to a Common Buzzard (Buteo buteo) or Red-tailed Hawk 
(B. jamaicensis)), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct, faster flight – despite the 
reduced size of aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some vultures. The 
smallest species of eagle is the South Nicobar Serpent Eagle (Spilornis klossi), at 450 g (1 lb) and 40 cm (16 in). 
The largest species are discussed below. Like all birds of prey, eagles have very large hooked beaks for tearing flesh
from their prey, strong muscular legs, and powerful talons. The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds 
of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful, having up to 3.6 times human acuity for the martial eagle, which enables 
them to spot potential prey from a very long distance. This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely 
large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming light. The female of all species of eagle 
known is larger than the male.

Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the 
older, larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. The dominant chick tends to be the female,
as they are bigger than the male. The parents take no action to stop the killing.
